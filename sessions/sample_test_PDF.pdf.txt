FastAPI is a modern Python web framework, very efficient in building APIs. FastAPI 
has been developed by Sebastian Ramirez in Dec. 2018. FastAPI 0.68.0 is the 
currently available version. The latest version requires Python 3.6 or above. It is 
one of the fastest web frameworks of Python. 
Each section gradually builds on the previous ones, but it's structured to separate topics, so 
that you can go directly to any specific one to solve your specific API needs. 
It is also built to work as a future reference. 
So you can come back and see exactly what you need.
